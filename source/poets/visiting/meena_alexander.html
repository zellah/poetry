{% block bio %}
<b>Meena Alexander</b> has called herself a “woman cracked by multiple migrations.” Born in India, raised in Sudan, educated in England, and currently a resident of New York City, she has drawn on experiences of trauma, exile, conflicting identity, and the customs of four continents to produce eight books of poetry, a memoir, and two novels. As she has said, “All my writing is haunted by place, the loss of it, the constantly shifting ‘I’ that tries to find a place in which to be.” Alexander’s “I” finds place in her gift of evocation, in its power to coax life out of a rock and to construct a sanctuary from a single memory. In Maxine Hong Kingston’s words, “Her voice guides us far away and back home. Her reader sees her visions and remembers and is uplifted.”

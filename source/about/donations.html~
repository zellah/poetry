<h3>Support Our Programming with a Gift of Any Size</h3>
<br/>
Weâ€™re truly grateful for the enthusiastic expressions of support we enjoy from students, staff, faculty, and poetry folk from all over New England. We strive to keep the reading series lively, current, surprising, and free to the public. Every gift helps one way or another, whether to fund a visit by a far-flung poet, our outreach activities, our video collection, our library, or our extensive student staff. If you share our goals and appreciate our programming, please give generously. We are grateful for gifts of all sizes.

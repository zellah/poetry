<h1> Broadsides </h1>

<br/>
<br/>In spring 2004, to commemorate the opening of the Poetry Center room in Wright Hall, we initiated a series of fine letterpress broadsides. 
<br/>
<br/>Barry Moser, distinguished artist and Printer-to-the college, donates his time to this project, designing and creating original engravings. Initial sales of broadsides (at a discounted price on the date of unveiling) cover the cost of production; subsequent sales support our programming. 
<br/>
<br/>These are limited edition broadsides, signed by both the author and the artist; prices rise as quantities diminish. Current prices are listed below. Framed copies of the broadsides are available for viewing in our Poetry Center room in Wright Hall (open week days 8 am- 4 pm). 
<br/>
<br/>In order to allow a wider audience to enjoy Barry Moser’s exquisite broadsides, quality reproductions of each are also available. Unlike the original letterpress broadsides, which may be ordered by mail, the reproductions are for sale at Poetry Center readings only, $15.00 each ($10.00 for students with valid I.D.). Cash and checks are accepted. 
<br/>
<br/>To order a broadside, please contact Jennifer Blackburn (jblackbu@smith.edu) 
<br/>
<br/>She will confirm price, and advise you of shipping & handling charges. On receipt of your check, we will mail you the broadside.

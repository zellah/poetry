<div class="rightcol" style="margin:40px 10px;">
Ellen Doré Watson is the author of five books of poems, including We Live in Bodies 

and Ladder Music, winner of the New England/New York award form Alice James 

Books, This Sharpening, and, most recently, Dogged Hearts. She has published 

individual poems widely in literary journals, including The American Poetry Review, 

Tin House, and The New Yorker. Her awards and honors include a Massachusetts 

Cultural Council Artists Grant, the Rona Jaffe Writers Award, Fellowships from the 

MacDowell Colony and the Vermont Studio Center, and a National Endowment for the 

Arts Translation Fellowship. Watson has translated a dozen books from the Brazilian 

Portuguese, including The Alphabet in the Park: Selected Poems of Adélia Prado, and 

has co-translated contemporary Arabic language poetry with Saadi Simawe. In addition 

to directing the Poetry Center, she leads writing workshops in the community, serves as 

Poetry and Translation Editor of the Massachusetts Review, and teaches in the Drew 

University Low-Res MFA Program in Poetry and Translation.

“I’ve never forgotten reading about a little girl who said that the pictures on the radio 

were so much more beautiful than the pictures on TV. Yes! Poems are radio in an age 

of TV. Reading poems on the page, listening to poems out loud, we are the place their 

meaning is made, their sound is heard, their intentions are imagined--and their beauty 

and terror come into our bodies. Poetry is good food.”

<div class="rightcol" style="margin:40px 10px;">
Born in Scotland, Annie Boutelle was educated at the University of St. Andrews and

New York University. She has taught in the Smith English Department since 1984. 

Author of Thistle and Rose: A Study of Hugh MacDiarmid’s Poetry and numerous 

essays on scholarly and popular topics, she has also published two books of poems, 

Becoming Bone: Poems on the Life of Celia Thaxter and Nest of Thistles. Founder 

of the Poetry Center at Smith, she devotes much of her time to writing and promoting 

poetry.

“Starting up the Poetry Center at Smith was not something I had planned to do, and yet 

when I look back, I can see that it fits perfectly with some of my earliest and strongest 

impulses. As a child, I loved poetry and I wrote it passionately during my teenage years. 

My Ph.D. thesis focused on the work of a great twentieth century Scottish poet, and 

almost al of my teaching here at Smith has focused on helping my students discover 

what makes language come alive. The 1996 proposal to establish a Poetry Center 

at Smith must surely have had something to do with the fact that I had, eight months 

earlier, launched myself on a project of writing a sequence of poems based on the life 

of Celia Thaxter, one of the most popular poets in nineteenth-century America. Since 

then, I’ve plunged into this life of writing and promoting poetry, and I feel as if I’ve come 

home. I’ve never been happier.”

frthcoming from rutgers university press (fall 03) titled “black women, identity, and 

cultural theory: (un)becoming the subject.” “there is, after all, no life, no living, without 

love. and poetry is love-full--lush, complicated, soothing, propelling me forth beyond 

edges, giving me the necessary pause.”

<div class="rightcol" style="margin:40px 10px;">
Peter N. Gregory joined the faculty at Smith College as the Jill Ker Conway Professor

of Religion and East Asian Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University on 

1981, he taught in the Program for the Study of Religion at the University of Illinois 

for fifteen years. He has also served as the President and Executive Director of the 

Kuroda Institute for the Study of Buddhism and Human Values since 1984, and in that 

capacity he has directed two publication series with the University of Hawaii Press: 

“Studies in East Asian Buddhism” and “Classics in East Asian Buddhism.” His research 

has focused on medieval Chinese Buddhism, especially the Chan (Zen) and Huayan 

traditions during the Tang and Song dynasties, on which he has written or edited seven 

books, including Tsung-mi and the Sinification of Buddhism (1991). He is currently 

completing a translation and study of a ninth-century Chinese Buddhism text on the 

historical and doctrinal origins of the Chan tradition. Since coming to Smith, his research 

and teaching have become increasingly concerned with Buddhism in America, and he 

has recently coedited Women Practicing Buddhism: American Experiences, which was 

published by Wisdom Publications in the fall of 2007. His interest in Chinese Buddhism 

and Zen was originally awakened by reading R.H. Blythe’s wonderful translations of 

Japanese Haiku and Gary Snyder’s crisp translations of Han-shan’s poems.

    <img width=150 src="http://smith.edu/poetrycenter/poets/malexander.jpg">
</div>
<div class="rightcol" style="margin:40px 10px;">
Michael Thurston grew up in the midwest and in Texas. He majored in English and

history as an undergraduate and took the M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of Illinois. 

After five years on the faculty at yale, he joined the English department at Smith in 

2000. Michael is the author of Making Something Happen: American Political Poetry 

Between the World Wars (University of North Carolina Press, 2001), and co-editor of 

Modernism, Inc.: Body, Memory, Capital (New York University Press, 2001). He has 

published essays on Langston Hughes, Muriel Rukeyser, Ernest Hemingway, Robert 

Lowell, and Eavan Boland, as well as numerous book reviews in Yale Review, Kenyon 

Review, Indiana Review, and other magazines. Michael teaches courses on American 

Literature, especially poetry, and on modern and contemporary British and Irish poetry.

“With its roots in song, poetry involves not only the mind and emotions but also the 

body. That complicated and complete involvement makes it, to me, wonderfully inviting 

and satisfying, whether the poem is ‘Ode on a Grecian Urn’ or ‘Anarchy in the U.K.’”

    <h3 id="SW">Sujane Wu</h3>
    <img width=150 src="http://smith.edu/poetrycenter/poets/malexander.jpg">
</div>
<div class="rightcol" style="margin:40px 10px;">
Born in Taiwan, Sujane Wu came to the United States in 1988 to study, and in 2005

joined the faculty here at Smith, where she teaches courses on traditional Chinese 

literature, culture, and language, as well as all levels of mandarin Chinese. Her literature 

and culture courses include The Culture of the Lyric in Traditional China ( EAL 231 ), 

Chinese Poetry and the Other Arts ( EAL 237 ), Chinese Travel Writing ( EAL 233), 

a seminar on the most famous Chinese novel, Dream of the Red Chamber [Honglou 

meng] (EAL 360), and a Presidential Seminar, Revising the Past in Chinese Literature 

and Film (PRS 316). Her research focuses primarily on the medieval Chinese poetry.

For more than two decades, Wu has been studying, performing and writing extensively 

about traditional Chinese poetry. One of her primary scholarly interests has been to 

reconstruct poems in musical performance, which she has come to see as necessary to 

a full appreciation of the poems themselves as well as the people who wrote and who 

listened to them. She has given musical performances of Chinese poetry in the United 

States as well as in Taiwan.

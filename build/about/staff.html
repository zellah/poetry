<h1> Poetry Center Staff </h1>

<p><b>
Jennifer Blackburn, Administrative Assistant<br/><br/>
</b>
<div class="leftcol"><img width=250 src="../static/images/about/JenBlackburn.jpeg"></div>
<div class="rightcol" style="margin:10px 10px;">
Born and raised in the not-so-wild wilds of suburban Boston, Jennifer earned her BA in English from

UMass-Amherst and her MFA in Poetry from the University of Arkansas. A published poet, her work 

appears in Subtropics, Hayden’s Ferry Review and the Journal, among other magazines.

“There’s something about all poetry that satisfies the puzzle player in me. Word play makes me shout 

and clap my hands. I love quiet poems, too— poems that are (on the surface) about nothing…poems 

that make readers see that what appeared to a dead end is actually a door to a larger, stranger world.”

<h3>Poetry Center Interns</h3>
<br/><br/>
<b>Liliana Farrell, ‘13, intern (Fall 2011- Spring 2013)</b>
<br/>
Liliana Farrell ’13 was born in Providence, RI and then proceeded to make a grand tour 

around the East Coast and Western Canada before she and her family settled near 

Washington D.C. She found refuge from her dust storm of creative turmoil in poetry 

(reading, listening) and film (watching, dissecting). Pretty soon she was committing pen 

to paper in yet another teenage, angst-ridden, misguided attempt at artistry. Poor kid. It 

ain’t easy being a writer.
<br/>
“One of the reasons I find poetry so engaging is that it continues to be relevant. We’re 

currently living in an age where fiction is dead and theatre is coming close to its curtain 

call. For people of every age and background, poetry is a way of expressing complex 

emotions and ideas in a concise and memorable form. How can I explain that a smear 

of a words on a page can change the way I look at the world? How can eighteen short 

lines of text sum up twenty years of muddled reflection? You’ll have to come to the 

Poetry Center to find out.”
<br/><br/>
<b>Janan Scott, 13’, intern (Fall 2011- Spring 2013)</b>
<br/>
Janan Scott ’13 was born in Nicosia, Cyprus and has lived a nomadic existence leaving 

roots scattered in many places including Pakistan, Kenya, France, and Baltimore, 

Maryland. She is happiest when among the trees and particularly enjoys making lentil 

soup and eating salad. She believes that spending time upside down is rejuvenating; 

she knows that family is precious, friendship is rare, and that anyone can write poems.

“Poetry is an act of improvisation. This does not mean it is born of randomness or 

coincidence; on the contrary it is the very deliberate reaction to the tug of gravity we 

encounter every day. Poetry, I think, is most concerned with the return to a state of 

playfulness, where only relentless curiosity allows the paper bag to become hat, the 

fork to become paintbrush, the cardboard box to become forest. Poetry, then, is how we 

become children again.”
<br/><br/>
<b>
Jamie Samdahl ’15, Poetry Center Intern<br/>
</b>
“Poetry is unruly. Literally. You can’t make rules about what is poetry and what isn’t. You want me 

to describe what poetry is? Poetry is language with or without constraints. Poetry is order and chaos. 

Words. Blank pages. Sound. Silence. You know poetry when you hear or see it, but your description is 

meaningless. Poetry simply is.” 

Jamie Samdahl ’15 grew up on her family’s mountainside blueberry farm in Princeton, Massachusetts. 

This has meant a lasting affinity for east-facing windows, homemade maple syrup, and slow dances by 

the woodstove. Passionate about poetry above all else, reading and writing have become as necessary 

to her body as eating or breathing. She has recently returned from living abroad in India where she spent 

a week on trains, studied in a monastery, and temporarily ordained as a Buddhist nun. 

“You never have to look far for poetry, and that’s a comfort. You hear it on blues radio, in the advice your 

mother gives you. Even without a book in reach, you dream it.”

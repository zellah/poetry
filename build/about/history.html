<h1> History </h1>

<h3>Auden and Plath- The Inspiration</h3>

<div class="leftcol">
<img width="250" src="../static/images/about/plath.jpg" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
</div><div class="rightcol" style="margin:10px;">
When W.H. Auden visited Smith in 1953, Sylvia Plath sat and listened to him read 
in Elizabeth Drew’s living room. Plath listened to the “burlap-textured voice and the 
crackling brilliant utterances.”
<p>
Later that night she wrote rhapsodically in her journal, “Oh, god, if this is life, half-heard, 
glimpsed, smelled with beer and cheese sandwiches and the god-eyed tall-minded 
ones, let me never go blind or get cut off from the agony of learning...”
</p><p>
Founded in 1997, and rapidly emerging as a major force on campus, The Poetry 
Center’s core mission is to bring to campus a succession of the “god-eyed tall-minded 
ones,” to inspire our students as Auden inspired Plath. Students in their hundreds 
attend the readings, which draw large community audiences as well, and feature poets 
of national and international stature.
</p>
</div>

<h3>History of the Poetry Center at Smith College</h3>

<p>
Launching her “2020” program in September 1996, President Ruth Simmons called 
on everyone at Smith to “Dream big dreams!” A few days later, driving home to West 
Chesterfield in the dark, Annie Boutelle, a lecturer in the English Department, suddenly 
knew what she longed to see at Smith: a Poetry Center.
</p>
<div class="leftcol">
<img width="350" src="../static/images/about/history1.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
</div>
<p>
With encouragement from English Department colleagues and poetry-lovers from other 
departments, and crucial assistance from senior Meredith Martin, Boutelle fleshed out 
the dream: a director, student interns, public readings, Q&A’s, a video archive, outreach 
to schools. The plan garnered vital support from students and alumnae, and a starter 
budget was allocated.
</p>
<p>
A Poetry Center Committee was formed, with Boutelle as chair, and participating 
faculty from various departments (see ABOUT US). Meanwhile, the poetry gods had 
fortuitously arranged that the English Department’s incoming Conkling Visiting poet 
would be Elizabeth Alexander, who had just run a poetry series at the University of 
Chicago, and who generously agreed to take on the directorship of the Center for her 
two-year stint at Smith. In September 1997, Eavan Boland packed Wright Auditorium to 
its seams for the Poetry Center’s inaugural reading.
</p>
<div class="leftcol">
<img width="200" src="../static/images/about/history2.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
</div>
<p>
Alexander brought with her a wide, embracing idea of what poetry is: a wide range 
of poets would come to Smith, with different politics, poetics, values, backgrounds, 
ethnicities, sexual orientations, and styles. Alexander set the tone: this was to be a 
vibrant energy-filled Poetry Center, celebrating poetry in its many shapes and guises. 
Students responded instantly with their presence: hundreds showed up at the readings. 
From the very start, a poetry buzz was in the air; and each audience was a wonderful 
blend of students, faculty, staff, and community folk.
</p><p>
Alexander and her students intern, Abe Louise Young, developed the concept of “box-
stuffers” (now known as “poetry postcards”).
</p>
<p>
These charming and colorful cards- each with its elegant design, short poem, and 
information about the reading- continue to this day: each person on campus receives 
one. We view the postcards as an important part of our mission, putting poems into the 
hands of people; and around campus one can often spot them, tacked on carrels, above 
secretaries’ desks, and pinned on office doors.
</p>
<img width="350" src="../static/images/about/history3.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<br/>

<div class="rightcol" style="float:right;">
<img width="200" src="../static/images/about/watson_e_d.jpg"">
</div>

<p>
As Alexander’s time at Smith drew to a close in 1999, the Poetry Center Committee 
received permission from College Hall to hire a new Director, and they were delighted 
to find Ellen Doré Watson, a poet and translator, who had curated poetry series at The 
Globe Bookshop and at Thorne’s, both in downtown Northampton. Watson picked up 
Alexander’s arms-wide-open policy and ran with it, adding the presence of international 
poets, whose work is read both in the original language and in translation.
</p><p>
Audiences have continued to build, ranging from 75 - 2,000. They surprise even the 
poets. Lawrence Ferlinghetti reported it was the longest line for a book signing he had 
ever seen. Stanley Kunitz counted his Smith reading, in terms of audience response, as 
one of the three best readings he had ever given. Mary Oliver had tears in her eyes to 
see the enormous and enormously excited crowd gathered in John M. Green Hall.
</p><h3>
Poetry Center Room
</h3>
<div class="leftcol">
<img width="300" src="../static/images/about/couches.jpg">
</div>
<p>
A quiet browsing room, with shelves filled with slim volumes of poetry and journals, was 
always one of the Poetry Center’s goals.
</p><p>
In 2004, thanks to Smith support and a gift from an anonymous donor, Wright Common 
Room was transformed into an elegant and calm space, filled with brightly colored, 
comfortable furniture. The room is used for individual browsing, for many poetry=related 
events (including all our Tuesday afternoon Q&A’s, which bring the visiting poet and 
Smith students together in an intimate way), and by various campus and community 
groups. Poet photos, taken by student photographer, announce the vitality and variety 
of our guests. Bookcases house signed copies of books by poets who have visited 
Smith, and book shelves are filled with poetry books and journals. Barry Moser’s 
stunning broadsides memorialize the dedication of the Poetry Center and Louise 
Gluck’s visit.
</p><p>
A glass World Wall not only celebrates poetry in general, with quotations about what 
poetry is; the Word Wall also honors the depth and breadth of the Poetry Center reading 
series, with a listing of all the poets who came to Smith from 1997 to 2003.
</p>
<div class="rightcol" style="float:right;">
<img width="250" src="../static/images/about/history4.png"">
</div>
<p>
Student interns design posters and poetry postcards in the adjoining office. Unless 
booked for college events, the Poetry Center is open during the semesters, Monday-
Friday, 8am to 4pm.
</p><h3>
Student Participation
</h3><p>
From the very beginning, students have played vital roles in the Poetry Center- from 
vision to daily operation. During the academic year we usually have from 8-10 students 
working in various capacities:
</p><ul><li>
Interns take responsibility for all aspects of producing, publicizing, and coordinating 
the readings in the Poetry Center series. This includes design, production, and 
distribution of posters, flyers, and poetry postcards; coordinating refreshments, 
room setup, and postering for readings and events. They also attend some of the 
dinners with the poets and serve alongside faculty on the Poetry Center policy-setting 
committee.
</li><li>
The Student Assistant to the Director compiles bibliographies of upcoming poets, 
researches and writes poet biographies and publicity text, helps to choose poems 
for Q&A packets, trains interns on the design software, coordinates volunteers, 
represents the Poetry Center at campus events, and serves on the Poetry Center 
Committee.
</li><li>
Stride Scholars assist with research, maintain the website, answer e-mail queries 
from all over the world; review videotapes of our readings and create indexes to make 
individual poems easily available for classroom use.
</li><li>
A work-study student assists Cindy Furtek in the Poetry Center office with photo-
copying, filing, postering, proofreading, scanning, photographs, and the like.
</li><li>
Student photographers have the rare experience of candidly photographing world-
famous poets. Some of their work is on display in the Poetry Center room.
</li><li>
Other miscellaneous poetry activities for students supported by the Poetry Center: 
two poets are chosen representatives of Smith each year to read at the annual Five 
College Poetryfest; students organize self-led writing and critique groups through 
meetings of the campus group WordSmith; student poets are invited to help screen 
manuscripts for the High School Poetry Prize.
</li></ul><h3>
Broadsides
</h3><p>
Distinguished artist and Printer-to-the-college, Barry Moser made two very handsome 
broadsides to commemorate the dedication of the Poetry Center in April 2004.
The first features original portraits of Sylvia Plath and W.H. Auden, as well as the 
excerpt form Plath’s journal which played a role in founder Annie Boutelle’s original 
vision of the Poetry Center as a place where young writers have the chance to meet 
“the god-eyed tall-minded ones.” The other, first in a series honoring visiting poets, and 
hand printed at the student printing office, is Louise Gluck’s poem “First Memory.”
Moser continues to donate his time to this project, designing and creating original 
engravings. Our website features a gallery of all broadsides to date: Plath/ Auden, 
Louise Gluck, Seamus Heaney, Gary Snyder, and Adrienne Rich. It’s easier than ever 
to purchase one of these treasures- and to support our programs at the same time.
</p><h3>
Outreach to Schools
</h3><p>
Outreach to schools has always been a part of the Poetry Center’s mission. During the 
initial years, outreach was limited to reserving seats at the readings for local schools, 
donating poetry books to the Northampton High School library, and offering Smith 
student assistance with their annual poetry slam.
</p><h3>
The Care Center
</h3><p>
Established in 1986, The Care Center in Hoyoke, MA, provides alternative-education 
for pregnant and parenting teens. Its young women, many of them Spanish-speakers, 
earn their high-school equivalency diplomas, with the support of on-site day care, 
parenting training, job placement, personal and career counseling, arts programming 
and athletics. We’ve facilitated visits to Tzivia Gover’s poetry class by a string of poets 
in our series, including Demetria Martinez, Joy Harjo, Nikky Finney, Naomi Shihab 
Nye, Mark Doty, and Sharon Olds; and Ellen Watson spent a lively session discussing 
translation with the student group editing the Care Center’s bilingual literary journal, 
Nautilus II. It has been thrilling to see poem-talk spill out onto Holyoke sidewalks!

</p><h3>
Poetry Prize for High School Girls
</h3><p>
In 2006, we launch our first annual Poetry Prize for High School Girls in Massachusetts 
(open to sophomores and juniors). Submissions will begin rolling in on October 1st, 
Naomi Shihab Nye graciously agreed to be our first judge. The winner receives a $500 
cash prize; she and three finalists will spend the day at Smith and present their winning 
work at Ms. Nye’s will spend the day at Smith and present their winning work at Ms. 
Nye’s evening reading, April 3, 2007. Please help us spread the word to teachers and 
students around the state. See guidelines and required entry form at:
</p><p>
www.smith.edu/poetrycenter/highschoolprize.html
</p><p>
We have also begun collaborations with local organizations whose mission involves 
bringing the power of the word to underserved populations:
</p><h3>
Voices from Inside
</h3><p>
Since 1999, western Massachusetts-based Voices from Inside has offered creative 
writing workshops where incarcerated and recently-released women write their stories 
in their own diverse voices. Voices from Inside’s mission also includes bringing the 
women’s writing to the larger community, to increase awareness of the human and 
financial costs of prisons.
</p><p>
When Ellen Watson visited a workshop held in the Hampden County House of 
Corrections, the courage and humanity of the women she met there impressed her 
deeply, and led to the idea of hosting a Voices reading at Smith. In fall 2005, she 
packed Weinstein auditorium witnessed firsthand the dignity and creativity of Voices 
from Inside writers.
</p><h3>
Hampshire County Jail Adult Learning Center
</h3>
<div class="leftcol">
<img width="300" src="../static/images/about/history5.png">
</div>
<p>
The Adult Learning Center at the Hampshire County Jail uses a cooperative learning 
model to help students gain both confidence and literacy, in classes that provide 
them with the skills necessary for greater self-sufficiency, improved employment 
opportunities, and a more thoughtful approach to life. Ellen Watson was honored to be a 
founding member of the Advisory Board to the Adult Learning Center and looks forward 
to learning more about the crucial literacy efforts underway right down the street from 
Smith. [link or contact info]
</p><h3>
Outreach Goals and Dreams
</h3><p>
In addition to ongoing relationships with the groups listed above, we dream of having 
the staff and funding to create some programs of our own, such as training students to 
bring poetry enrichment to urban schools and offering teachers support for their own 
creative work.
</p><p>
Funding from a variety of college sources and from alumnae & community donors 
has grown each year, and we are very grateful to those who have supported us. Our 
deepest need is for an endowment that will guarantee that the Poetry Center will 
be here for generations of Smith students and of poetry lovers in the surrounding 
communities.
